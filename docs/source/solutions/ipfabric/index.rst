.. note::
   This Automation Suite has been deprecated. New installations should use the Network Essentials and
   DC Fabric Automation Suites. These are now available as Technology Preview. See `bwc-docs.brocade.com
   <https://bwc-docs.brocade.com/latest/solutions/dcfabric/overview.html>`_ for more information on how
   to install and use these new suites. Note that there is no direct upgrade path from IP Fabric Automation
   Suite to DC Fabric Automation Suite
