ZTP and Brocade Workflow Composer Overview
==========================================

Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) can be used to bring up the switch with new firmware and a
preset configuration automatically, so that you do not need to log in to the switch
console to configure the switch for a working condition. ZTP uses a DHCP-based process
known as DHCP Automatic Deployment (DAD) to handle basic configuration, such as assigning
a VCS ID, VCS mode, an RBridge ID, and downloading firmware. 

For more information, refer to the **Brocade Network OS Administration Guide** under *Using DHCP Automatic Deployment*.
