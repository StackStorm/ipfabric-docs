ZTP and Brocade Workflow Composer Overview
==========================================

Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) can be used to bring up a switch with new firmware and a
preset configuration automatically. The switch does not need to be configured via the
console. ZTP uses a DHCP-based processvknown as DHCP Automatic Deployment (DAD) to 
handle basic configuration, such as assigning a VCS ID, VCS mode, an RBridge ID, and 
downloading firmware. 

For more information, refer to the `Using DHCP Automatic Deployment <http://www.brocade.com/content/html/en/administration-guide/nos-701-adminguide/GUID-B70DA4FE-6819-45A9-9E07-65785D7DB402.html>`_ section of the `Brocade Network OS Administration Guide <http://www.brocade.com/content/html/en/administration-guide/nos-701-adminguide/GUID-E7A18ADA-3D26-475A-BE56-13088EC74EFF-homepage.html>`_.
