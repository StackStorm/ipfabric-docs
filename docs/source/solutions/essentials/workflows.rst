Network Essentials Actions
==========================

This is a reference documentation for Network Essentials Actions and Workflows to automate Brocade VDX and SLX switches. These actions can be used as independent actions, or as part of a more complex workflow. :doc:`Actions</actions>` can be manually triggered, or they can be tied to :doc:`sensors </sensors>` using rules.

Most of the actions below can be used to automate Brocade SLX or VDX switches, however there are few actions that are only valid for  VDX switches as outlined below. If an action is only valid for VDX it will be documented in the action details, otherwise the action is supported for both VDX and SLX.
