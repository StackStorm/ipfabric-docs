Installation
============

.. note::
    During Technology Preview phase, there is one single installation for all suites. In future
    there will be separate installation scripts for each suite, so customers can choose which
    suite(s) they wish to run. 

    To install Network Essentials, follow the installation instructions for the :doc:`DC Fabric Automation
    Suite <../dcfabric/install>`

* New to |bwc|? Go to fundamentals - start with :doc:`/start`.
* Understand the Network Essentials :doc:`Actions and Workflows<workflows>`.
