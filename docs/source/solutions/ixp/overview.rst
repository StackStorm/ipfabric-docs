.. warning::

    All Automation Suites are currently in "Technology Preview" phase. We are releasing them
    to gain additional feedback, but do not recommend running them in production. We encourage
    people to try them out in non-production scenarios. They have had basic testing, but are
    not fully supported by Brocade TAC.

Overview
--------

Network Essentials is a foundational set of workflows for operating Brocade network devices. It
includes actions such as port provisioning, SNMP, NTP & AAA configuration. These are basic building
blocks that are used by other suites. Customers can also use these blocks to create their own
customised workflows.

Included Actions
----------------

Actions in this suite include:

* Edge port configuration
* VRRPe configuration
* SNMP configuration
* Syslog configuration
* NTP configuration and validation

For more information about each action, read the :doc:`operation` guide.
